# Spotify music analysis
Using python, I analyzed spotify data, which arised from the data cleaning folder. Here I answer in many questions that I considered to be important for the specific business case. For a presentation of the main results, please see the [presentation folder](https://github.com/mgerasimidis/E_D_A-projects-python/tree/main/Spotify_Analysis/presentation).

### Content
#### General Analysis
Here I answer to various questions considering the releases of tracks. Tracks releases per year, how many tracks do albums contain in average throughout the years, which month do most track releases occure and other.
#### Analysis part_1
Exploring track releases per genre (pop,latin,rap,r&b,edm,rock) and average popularity per track. Who were the top 10 artists of 2019, considering how many tracks they had released that year and which was the average popularity of the tracks. Afterwards, investigating if any of those were top (based on the same criteria) for the three previous years.
#### Analysis part_2
Here I investigated how track features have changed throughout the years and especially for the years 2019,2020 (covid years). I considered various features of tracks, given by Spotify, such as **mood** (valence, danceability, energy, tempo), **properties** (loudness, speachness, instrumentalness) and **context** (liveness, acousticness).
